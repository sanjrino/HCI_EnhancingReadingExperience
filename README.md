# HCI_EnhancingReadingExperience
How to improve reading experience? why not slap VR into that

todo:

logic:
each book should be its own page (eg SkyrimBook1Page.html) that we can "download" from store, and would then show up in library. We can just create 2 folders one named StoreBooks and other Library books, and adding a book from store  would just mean copying it to the library folder.

implement everything better than this draft

looks:
Everything looks like shit, i hate html css. can someone make it pretty?

anyways... Reading page I did in 3d, found a cool way to do it. you can walk using wasd keys and drag the visuals. Ideas?
