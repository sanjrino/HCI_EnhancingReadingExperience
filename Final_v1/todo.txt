Hello,

For now we have a couple of working parts, but still missing the integration itself.

1)  I'd stick with the node version of the file transfering. We have to make it work with the other pages, and of course rename the folders

2) After it is done, we need to make the library output the books we have, and speaking of:

3) I did one book prototype, It needs to be much more lookable (Book scaled correctly, more text formatted in a better way etc)

4)  Final polishing touches, including doing some CSS and maybe js animations. This is the last step.


The tasks are in importance order. First we do 1, then 2 etc.
